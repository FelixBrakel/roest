Day9 30 day project that got out of hand and became a playground for Rust/Cargo and OpenGL. Currently not in a working state unfortunately. 

Implements a forward OpenGL renderer built on top of legion ECS. Also contains some complicated macros for generating the OpenGL API calls to connect a rust struct to one in a shader.
